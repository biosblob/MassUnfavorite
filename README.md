MassUnfavorite
==============

A small iMacros script to mass unfavorite your tweets on Twitter. 

Evidence: [http://twitter.com/@biosblob/favorites](http://twitter.com/@biosblob/favorites)
</br>Download iMacros: [http://www.iopus.com/imacros/firefox/](http://www.iopus.com/imacros/firefox/)
</br>Recommended browser: Firefox (with the iMacros add-on).
***
When in the iMacros interface, set the loop to a maximum value over 9000 (or any value you think is suitable). Also, there is a JS script that essentially does what the iMacros script does. 

ANOTHER NOTE: I would change the relay speed to MEDIUM or SLOW if the /favorites page isn't loading quick enough.
